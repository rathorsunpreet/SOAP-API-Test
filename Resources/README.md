# Resouces

This is the folder which is dynamically located by the project and the two files within are read. It is also the output folder for the project.

## Files
The following files are present:


1. [list-of-countries.txt](https://gist.github.com/dariusz-wozniak/656f2f9070b4205c5009716f05c94067#file-list-of-countries-txt) from
[dariusz-wozniak](https://gist.github.com/dariusz-wozniak)'s GIST.
2. `no-iso-countries.txt` created by `Sunpreet Singh Rathor` during the build of this project.

## Usage
The two files are read programmatically by a `Groovy Step` within the Test Case `Complex Test Case - Data Driven`.

The output file `full-country-info.csv` is also generated here.
